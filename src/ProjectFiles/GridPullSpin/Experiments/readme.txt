Run 'python2.6 generate_projects.py ../../GridPullSpin2D.lua <seed_value> <nr_of_runs>' in the directory where the files
'generate_projects.py' and 'swarmfile.template' lie. The resulting swarm files can be loaded by the RSS from the same
directory. The experiments can be started as a batch job by running 'python2.6 run_experiments.py <seed_value>'. Note
that the seed values in both calls must match.
