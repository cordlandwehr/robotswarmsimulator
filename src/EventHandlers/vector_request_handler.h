 * \brief Handles vector requests (e.g. position, velocity and acceleration requests).
 *
 * To configure a vector request handler, you can add so called vector modifiers. Given a request to be handled, the
 * vector request handler extracts the corresponding vector and applies all initially provided vector modifiers to it
 * (in the same order they were added to the vector request handler). The resulting vector is used to build a new,
 * modified request which is afterwards handled normally.
 *
 * If there is need for more sophisticated request handling, one may still subclass VectorRequestHandler and overwrite
 * the 'handle_request_reliable' method.
