\section{Input-file Specifications}

There are exactly four kinds of input files for the \RSS. This includes the project specification files and also the \Lua-script-files that define the robot behavior.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The main projectfile containing information about the model. The extension of this type of file is ``.swarm''.
	\item A file containing robot information. The extension of this file is ``.robot''.
	\item A file containing obstacle information. The extension of this file is ``.obstacle''.
	\item \Lua\ file that describes the robot behavouir. The extension of this file is ``.lua''.
\end{enumerate}
For easier handling of the robot and obstacle files it is also possible to take the ending ``.csv''. In this case the ending also must be part of the filename in the main projedtfile.

\subsection{Main projectfile}
The following specifications hold only for the main projectfile (with extension \texttt{.swarm}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item A comment begins with a '\#'.
	\item A line is a comment line (beginning with a '\#'), an empty line or a line containing a variable followed by an equal sign followed by a \emph{quoted} value of this variable. Example:
	\begin{verbatim}
		VAR_1="value"
		VAR_2 = "value"
		VAR_3= "value"
		VAR_4 ="value"
	\end{verbatim}
	\item a variable name has to be of the following form: \texttt{[A-Z0-9\_]$^+$}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Variables}
The main project file contains the variables defined in Tables~\ref{tab:mainvars} and \ref{tab:mainvars2}.
	
Also the following should be considered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The order of the variables in the main project file is not important.
	\item If a variable does not appear in the main projectfile, then its default value will be used if such a default value does exist (otherwise an exception will be thrown while loading the main project-file).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example of a main project file}\index{project file!example}
A main project file may look like:
\lstset{language=tcl}
\begin{lstlisting}
# 
# Description about configuration.
#
	
	PROJECT_NAME="My Exciting Project"
	COMPASS_MODEL="NO_COMPASS"

\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Robot file}\index{robot file}
Tho robot file contains all information about the individual robots. Each non-comment line\footnote{The first line is always a comment, even if not marked as comment.} of this file represents one robot. One line represents the individual information of one robot in a CVS compatible format. That means, between each values is a comma and the information are given in a well defined order.

Therefore the information for one robot has to be saved in exactly one line of the file. Again: the order of this data is important!

\subsubsection{Order of information in one line}
The first line of a robot file generated by the \RSS looks like the following. This is also the order of how information must be set into one row.
\begin{lstlisting}
	  "ID","x-position","y-position","z-position","type","x-velocity","y-velocity","z-velocity","x-acceleration","y-acceleration","z-acceleration","status","marker-info","algorithm","color","x-axis-1","x-axis-2","x-axis-3","y-axis-1","y-axis-2","y-axis-3","z-axis-1","z-axis-2","z-axis-3"
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Meaning of columns}
\begin{description}
	\item [ID] The robot ID number.
	\item [(x/y/z)-position] The initial position, each as floating point value. 
	\item [type] The robot type (for instance master, slave,$\ldots$).
	\item [(x/y/z)-velocity] The initial velocity, each as floating point value. If not needed, set to $0$.
	\item [(x/y/z)-acceleration] The initial acceleration, each as floating point value. If not needed, set to $0$.
	\item [status] Initial status (needs to be defined in you algorithm).%TODO more information!
	\item [marker-info] Initial marker information. %TODO (still has to be specified)
	\item [algorithm] The robot algorithm to use for calculation an moving. You can either set this to a hard-coded robot algorithm provided by the \RSS, or to a \Lua-Script algorithm.
	  \begin{itemize}
	  	\item To use a robot algorithm from the \RSS just specify the name.
		\item To use a \Lua-Script insert the name of the file, including the ending ``.lua''. This may be an relativ path to this file.
	  \end{itemize}
	%TODO give names of all robot algorithms!
	\item [color] This value gives the color the robot has during the \RSS simulation. This color is only utilized in visualization and does not have any effect on the simulation itself. You can use color for instance for a special treatment during the visualization. The color value is an integer from $0$ to $9$. Each value represents a color:
		\begin{description}
			\item [0] green
			\item [1] blue
			\item [2] cyan
			\item [3] red
			\item [4] magenta
			\item [5] yellow
			\item [6] white
			\item [7] black
			\item [8] orange
			\item [9] purple
		\end{description}
	\item [(x/y/z)\texttimes(x/y/z)\texttimes(x/y/z) coordinate system axes] The coordinate system is represented by three vectors. Thus you need to specify three times three coordinates to uniquely define all axis.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Please Note}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each non-number needs to be quoted.
	\item Each number may be quoted or not.
	\item You can declare specific lines as comments by setting \# as the first sign of the corresponding line.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Example of a robot file}
\begin{lstlisting}
	"ID","x-position","y-position","z-position","type","x-velocity","y-velocity","z-velocity","x-acceleration","y-acceleration","z-acceleration","status","marker-info","algorithm","color","x-axis-1","x-axis-2","x-axis-3","y-axis-1","y-axis-2","y-axis-3","z-axis-1","z-axis-2","z-axis-3"
	0,5.3,9.2,6.4,"master",1.5,2.5,3.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,"sleeping",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
	1,"2.5","4.2","8.8","slave",1.5,2.5,3.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,"ready",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Obstacle file}\index{obstacle file}
Like the robot file the obstacle file uses a csv-compatible format. 
Therefore the information for one robot has to be saved in exactly one line of the file.
Each line contains the following data. The order of this data is important!

You can declare specific lines as comments by setting \# as the first sign of
the corresponding line.
\begin{itemize}
	\item type (marker, sphere or box)
	\item position $(x,y,z)$
	\item marker information (still needs to be specified)
	\item $x/y/z$-lengths or radius (depending on type)
\end{itemize}

The first line always is (column headers):
\begin{lstlisting}
"type","x-position","y-position","z-position","marker-info","size-info","",""
\end{lstlisting}
Each non-number is quoted.


\subsubsection{Example of an obstacle file}
\begin{lstlisting}
"type","x-position","y-position","z-position","marker-info","size-info","",""
"box",2.0,3.0,4.0,0,1.0,2.0,3.0,
"sphere",3.4,5.2,5.1,0,5.0,"",""
"marker",3.5,1.4,5.1,0,"","",""
\end{lstlisting}
As you can already see in the example, if the type of an obstacle is sphere, then the last two values must be empty, i.\,e. '',''. Analoguos, if the type is marker, the last three values must be empty, i.\,e. '','',''.
