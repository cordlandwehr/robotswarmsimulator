\subsection{Detailed Description}
An Acceleration \hyperlink{class_request}{Request} is issued by a robot which wants to change its acceleration to a new value. 

Notes: The new acceleration is expressed in terms of the local coordinate system of the robot. This means it has to be transformed before using.

The request cannot be changed after construction.
